       shall provide the Disclosing Party with a certificate, executed
       by the Receiving Party or by an officer of the Receiving Party,
       confirming that all copies of all such Confidential Information
       have been returned to the Disclosing Party or destroyed, as the
       case may be.

            Documentation and executes and delivers evidence of such
            actions to Licensor or its authorized distributor.

Article 22. Limitation of Liabilities
    1. In the event that Licensor provides Licensed Software or services
       to Licensee free of charge, e.g., the provision of the Licensed
       Software during a trial period or for research, academic or
       marketing purposes, this shall be on an "as is" basis under
       exclusion of any warranty obligations and Licensor will only be
       liable for damages resulting from any intentional or grossly
       negligent violation of its contractual duties.

       ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
       ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT OR USE OF

       DOCUMENTATION PURSUANT TO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR THE PERIOD
       OF THE LAST SIX (6) MONTHS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
    4. Applicability of Disclaimers and Limitations. Licensee agrees
       that the limitations of liability and disclaimers set forth in
       this License Agreement will apply regardless of whether Licensee
       has accepted Software, web services, or Documentation or any
       other product or service delivered by Licensor. The parties agree
       that Licensor has set its fees and entered into this License
       Agreement in reliance on the disclaimers and limitations set
       forth herein, that the same reflect an allocation of risk between
       the parties, and that the same form an essential basis of the
       bargain between the parties. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY
       NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED
       REMEDY.

Article 23. Assignment
Licensee is not allowed to assign or transfer any contractual rights or
duties to third parties, including any affiliates of Licensee, unless it

its contractual rights and duties (in whole or in part) to its
affiliates and third parties even without the consent of Licensee.

Article 24. Individual Agreement, Amendment and Waiver
    1. This Agreement shall govern the relationship between Licensor and

       license agreement signed between Licensor and Licensee. The
       latter shall always prevail over the provisions of this
       Agreement.
    2. This Agreement may be amended unilaterally by the Licensor. Each
       and every amendment shall take effect within thirty (30) days as
       of the day the amendments are reflected at the following link:

    3. No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a written
       document executed by the party entitled to the benefits of the
       provision.
    4. No waiver of a provision will be deemed to be or will constitute
       a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. A waiver will
       be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose
       for which it was given, and will not constitute a continuing
       waiver.

Article 25. No Benefit to Others
    1. There are no intended third party beneficiaries of this
       Agreement.
    2. The representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements
       contained in this Agreement are for the sole benefit of the
       parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
       and they are not to be construed as conferring any rights on any
       other persons.

       Bulgaria.

       documents or witnesses relevant to the major aspects of the
       dispute.

Article 27. Force Majeure
Licensor shall not be responsible for failures of its obligations under
this Agreement to the extent that such failure is due to causes beyond
Licensor's control including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, acts
of any government or agency thereof, fire, explosions, epidemics,
quarantine restrictions, strikes, delivery services, telecommunication
providers, strikes, labor difficulties, lockouts, embargoes, severe
weather conditions, delay in transportation, or delay of suppliers or
subcontractors.

Article 28. Severability
If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or
unenforceable by any court, such provision shall be ineffective only to
the extent that it is in contravention of applicable laws without
invalidating the remaining provisions of the Agreement. The invalid or
missing provision shall be replaced by such a valid provision that most
closely reflects the economic and business intention of the parties at
the time the agreement was concluded.

Article 29. Headings
Headings used in this Agreement are provided for convenience only and
