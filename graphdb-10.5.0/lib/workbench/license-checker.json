Visit http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/!\n\n# Installation\n\nInstallation is easy as UI Bootstrap has minimal dependencies - only the AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap's CSS are required.\nNote: Since version 0.13.0, UI Bootstrap depends on [ngAnimate](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate) for transitions and animations, such as the accordion, carousel, etc. Include `ngAnimate` in the module dependencies for your app in order to enable animation.\n\n#### Install with NPM\n\n```sh\n$ npm install angular-ui-bootstrap\n```\n\nThis will install AngularJS and Bootstrap NPM packages.\n\n#### Install with Bower\n```sh\n$ bower install angular-bootstrap\n```\n\nNote: do not install 'angular-ui-bootstrap'.  A separate repository - [bootstrap-bower](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap-bower) - hosts the compiled javascript file and bower.json.\n\n#### Install with NuGet\nTo install AngularJS UI Bootstrap, run the following command in the Package Manager Console\n\n```sh\nPM> Install-Package Angular.UI.Bootstrap\n```\n\n#### Custom build\n\nHead over to http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/ and hit the *Custom build* button to create your own custom UI Bootstrap build, just the way you like it.\n\n#### Manual download\n\nAfter downloading dependencies (or better yet, referencing them from your favorite CDN) you need to download build version of this project. All the files and their purposes are described here:\nhttps://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/tree/gh-pages#build-files\nDon't worry, if you are not sure which file to take, opt for `ui-bootstrap-tpls-[version].min.js`.\n\n### Adding dependency to your project\n\nWhen you are done downloading all the dependencies and project files the only remaining part is to add dependencies on the `ui.bootstrap` AngularJS module:\n\n```js\nangular.module('myModule', ['ui.bootstrap']);\n```\n\nIf you're a Browserify or Webpack user, you can do:\n\n```js\nvar uibs = require('angular-ui-bootstrap');\n\nangular.module('myModule', [uibs]);\n```\n\n# Support\n\n## FAQ\n\nhttps://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/wiki/FAQ\n\n## Supported browsers\n\nDirectives from this repository are automatically tested with the following browsers:\n* Chrome (stable and canary channel)\n* Firefox\n* IE 9 and 10\n* Opera\n* Safari\n\nModern mobile browsers should work without problems.\n\n\n## Need help?\nNeed help using UI Bootstrap?\n\n* Live help in the IRC (`#angularjs` channel at the `freenode` network). Use this [webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/) or your own IRC client.\n* Ask a question in [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) under the [angular-ui-bootstrap](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angular-ui-bootstrap) tag.\n\n**Please do not create new issues in this repository to ask questions about using UI Bootstrap**\n\n## Found a bug?\nPlease take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#you-think-youve-found-a-bug) and submit your issue [here](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/issues/new).\n\n\n----\n\n\n# Contributing to the project\n\nWe are always looking for the quality contributions! Please check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contribution guidelines.\n\n# Development, meeting minutes, roadmap and more.\n\nHead over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/wiki) for notes on development for UI Bootstrap, meeting minutes from the UI Bootstrap team, roadmap plans, project philosophy and more."

Check out the [ngTagsInput website](http://mbenford.github.io/ngTagsInput) for more information.\n\n## Requirements\n\n - AngularJS 1.3+\n - A modern browser (Chrome 31+, Firefox 29+, Safari 7+, Opera 12+, IE 10+)\n\n## Installing\n\nAll files are available from a variety of sources. Choose the one that best fits your needs:\n\n- Direct download (https://github.com/mbenford/ngTagsInput/releases)\n- NPM (`npm install ng-tags-input --save`)\n- Bower (`bower install ng-tags-input --save`)\n- CDNJS (http://cdnjs.com/libraries/ng-tags-input)\n\nYou can also grab the [latest build](#latest-build) generated by Travis. It's fully functional and may contain new features and bugfixes not yet published to the services listed above.\n\nNow all you have to do is add the scripts to your application. Just make sure the `ng-tags-input.js` file is inserted **after** the `angular.js` script:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"angular.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"ng-tags-input.js\"></script>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"ng-tags-input.css\">\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n 1. Add the `ngTagsInput` module as a dependency in your AngularJS app;\n 2. Add the custom element `<tags-input>` to the HTML file where you want to use an input tag control and bind it to a property of your model. That property, if it exists, must be an array of objects and each object must have a property named `text` containing the tag text;\n 3. Set up the options that make sense to your application;\n 4. Enable autocomplete, if you want to use it, by adding the directive `<auto-complete>` inside the `<tags-input>` tag, and bind it to a function of your model. That function must return either an array of objects or a promise that eventually resolves to an array of objects (same rule from step 2 applies here);\n 5. Customize the CSS classes, if you want to.\n 6. You're done!\n\n**Note:** There's a more detailed [getting started](http://mbenford.github.io/ngTagsInput/gettingstarted) guide on the ngTagsInput website.\n\n## Example\n\n```html\n<html>\n<head>\n    <script src=\"angular.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"ng-tags-input.min.js\"></script>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"ng-tags-input.min.css\">\n    <script>\n        angular.module('myApp', ['ngTagsInput'])\n            .controller('MyCtrl', function($scope, $http) {\n                $scope.tags = [\n                    { text: 'just' },\n                    { text: 'some' },\n                    { text: 'cool' },\n                    { text: 'tags' }\n                ];\n                $scope.loadTags = function(query) {\n                     return $http.get('/tags?query=' + query);\n                };\n            });\n    </script>\n</head>\n<body ng-app=\"myApp\" ng-controller=\"MyCtrl\">\n    <tags-input ng-model=\"tags\">\n        <auto-complete source=\"loadTags($query)\"></auto-complete>\n    </tags-input>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Options\n\nCheck out the [documentation](http://mbenford.github.io/ngTagsInput/documentation/api) page for a detailed view of all available options.\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can see the directive in action in the [demo page](http://mbenford.github.io/ngTagsInput/demos).\n\n## Contributing\n\nBefore posting an issue or sending a pull request, make sure to read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/mbenford/ngTagsInput/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\n## License\n\nSee the [LICENSE](https://github.com/mbenford/ngTagsInput/blob/master/LICENSE) file.\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mbenford/ngTagsInput/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) page.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nThe following are some alternatives to ngTagsInput you may want to check out:\n\n- [angular-tags](http://decipherinc.github.io/angular-tags): Pure AngularJS tagging widget with typeahead support courtesy of ui-bootstrap\n- [angular-tagger](https://github.com/monterail/angular-tagger): Pure Angular autocomplete with tags, no jQuery\n- [jsTag](https://github.com/eranhirs/jstag): Open source project for editing tags (aka tokenizer) based on AngularJS\n- [bootstrap-tagsinput](http://timschlechter.github.io/bootstrap-tagsinput/examples): jQuery plugin providing a Twitter Bootstrap user interface for managing tags (provides Angular support)\n\n## Latest build\n\n- Compressed: [ng-tags-input.min.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ng-tags-input/ng-tags-input.min.zip)\n- Uncompressed: [ng-tags-input.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ng-tags-input/ng-tags-input.zip)"
