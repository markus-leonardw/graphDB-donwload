Prerequisites
-------------
GraphDB is a Java application and requires Java 11. Make sure you have an up-to-date Java 11 installation.
You can download Java from https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml.

Starting GraphDB
----------------
Run the graphdb script in the bin directory. To access the Workbench, open http://localhost:7200 in a browser.

To run GraphDB on a different port, add the parameter "-Dgraphdb.connector.port=<your-port>".
This option can also be set in the config file graphdb.properties in the conf directory.

To run GraphDB in server-only mode without the embedded Workbench, add the parameter "-s".

License
-------
GraphDB needs a software license. If you have not received a license, please contact Ontotext.
The license can be set through the GraphDB Workbench:

    1) Go to Setup -> Repositories.
    2) Click the key icon next to the active location.
    3) Click the Set up license button and either upload a license file or paste the ASCII version of the license.

If a license is missing or invalid the Set up license button will be shown on the home screen as well.

For alternative ways to set the license, please refer to
http://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/enterprise/ee/setting-up-licenses.html.

Creating Repositories
---------------------
By default, the GraphDB will initialise a location but not create any repositories.
You can create a new repository or connect to an existing one from the menu Setup -> Repositories page
in the GraphDB Workbench:

    - To create a new repository in the location, click on "Create new repository" and fill in the form.
    - To connect to a repository, use the dropdown in the menu or the slider next to the repo name on the same page.
